 abstract = {Many Western readers currently accept an account of the early evolution of Chinese script due to William Boltz, according to whom all graphs other than simple pictographs originated as phonetic—semantic compounds. This contrasts with the traditional Chinese account of 六書 'six writings', according to which some graphs were compounds of separate elements each chosen for their meaning rather than their sound. This paper argues that (while the 'six writings' theory had flaws) with respect to that central issue it is correct, and Boltz is mistaken. 在西方學界，人們普遍接受 William Boltz 關于漢字早期發展的理論. Boltz 認爲除了象形字以外，所有其他的漢字都應該源于形聲字。 Boltz 的理論同傳統的六書理論是相抵觸的. 在許慎的六書理論中，有一組漢字，也就是許慎所定義的會意字，是由兩個或兩個以上的符號因爲其各自代表的意義而結合起來所形成的。 在這篇論文中，我們將證明在會意字這個漢字範疇上，六書理論是正確的，儘管其理論有其_身的缺陷，而 Boltz 的理論是錯誤的。},
